# Variable naming issue: ◁h is not a valid variable name in Python.
# In Python, variable names typically consist of letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
# Variable names cannot start with a number and cannot include special characters, Korean characters, etc.
# Therefore, ◁h is not a valid variable name.
