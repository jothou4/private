## Escaping Double Quotes:
When you want to include double quotes within a string in Python, you use a backslash (\) to escape them.
This allows you to print the actual double quote character (") as part of the output string.

# Example:
print("\"Python is powerful.\" She explains.")
# Output: "Python is powerful." She explains.
